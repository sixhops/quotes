# Quotes
Quote generator using AngularJS

# Background / Objective
Originally this was a project from FreeCodeCamp spec'd to be written in html/css/js only. I completed that project and then later set to refactoring it using AngularJS (1.6). Primarily, the goal was to gain more familiarity with Angular and have a portfolio piece that I could display.

# Result
The same effect was achieved using less code. Updating of the DOM was much easier. Without analysis tools, its difficult to say if any performance was gained but it seems marginally slower by a very small amount.
